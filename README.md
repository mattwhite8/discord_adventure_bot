## Discord Adventure Bot

A Discord bot for a text-based adventure game. Users explore rooms, interact with the world, and manage their character stateâ€”all via Discord commands.

### Features

- Connects to Discord using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/)
- Persistent game world and player state stored in SQLite
- Database migrations for schema and initial world setup

- Extensible for new commands and features

### Database Structure

- **RoomConnections**: Maps navigable directions between rooms
